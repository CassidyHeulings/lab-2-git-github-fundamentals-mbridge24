(change to html and make it pretty)
I'm Cassidy Heulings.
I'm a sophomore majoring in computer science and cybersecurity.
This is my first time wokring with Github, CSS, Javascript, and HTML.

I learned the basics of how to use github and what the differetn compnents of github are.
Im still confused about some basic html and css code, but I will be doing some practice with these languages.
